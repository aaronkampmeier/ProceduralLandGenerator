Welcome to Aaron Kampmeier's Procedural Land Generation program!

To run this program cd into the directory level of this README file, make sure there exists an "out" directory, and then
 simply run "make". To run, execute "./out/Assignment_3".

You can also run "make clean" to clean up the build dir.

There is also a CMakeLists file if you prefer to use CMake.
