 * LandType. However, if it were to hold multiple records of the same LandType (and 0 records of some other LandTypes),
 * this would not practically cause a problem as the probabilities of the same type would just be added together.
 *
 * And yes yes, I know. I really would have rather used a map (or similar) structure here, but I wasn't sure we were
 * allowed to pull in other libraries like that. So instead I just architected it this way with an array of structs
 * containing a "key" (LandType) and a "value" (probability). I guess this is kinda a primitive map implementation
 * anyway just without the enforcement of only one record for a specific key.
